This article provided a clear understanding of deep learning and understanding basic neural networks. I appreciated how it started with the example of Dr. Emily observing birds, which showed how innovations often come from nature. Just like airplanes were inspired by birds, neural networks are modelled on the human brain. They mimic the human brain to process information, involve a series of algorithms recognizing data patters and are the foundation of deep learning and machine learning.
The brief history section showed how neural networks started with early models in the 1940s and gradually evolved into modern systems like AlphaGo. It made me realize that progress in AI has been steady over decades, shaped by both ideas and advances in computing power.
The main concept I learned is that neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, which use weights, biases, and activation functions to process data and generate outputs. The article explained how perceptrons are the simplest form of neural networks, but their limitations led to the development of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). By adding hidden layers, MLPs can solve more complex and non-linear problems, which makes them super powerful.
The role of activation functions was another key insight for me. I learned that they serve as the backbone of deep learning, enabling communication among neurons within a neural network. They help in determining whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the input it receives. Without them, networks would only handle linear tasks. Functions like Threshold, Sigmoid, Hyperbolic Tangent Functions (tanh), and ReLU add non-linearity, allowing the network to capture complex patterns in data. The coding examples with output graphs really helped me see how the theory translates into practice.
Overall, the article helped me understand that deep learning doesn’t mean computers “think” like humans, but rather that they can recognize patterns and perform human-like tasks at scale. It also made me appreciate how much of the technology I use every day like translations, recommendations, and image recognition relies on these principles.
